1. Function 1: Check Inventory
○ Scenario: When a customer tries to place an order, the system needs to check if
the requested items are in stock.
○ Objective: Write a function that accepts an itemId and the quantity the
customer wants to purchase. The function should check if the stock level for that
item is sufficient and return either true (enough stock) or false (not enough
stock).
○
2. Function 2: Create Order
○ Scenario: Once inventory is confirmed, the system should create a new order for
the customer.
○ Objective: Write a function that accepts a customerId and an array of items
(each containing an itemId and quantity). The function should validate if all
items are in stock (using the checkInventory function). If successful, it should
return an order object (with a unique order ID, customer ID, and list of ordered
items), otherwise return an error message.

Example Output:
{
orderId: 'ORD123',
customerId: 45,
items: [
{ itemId: 1, quantity: 2 },
{ itemId: 3, quantity: 1 }
]
}

3. Function 3: Update Stock
○ Scenario: After a successful order, the system needs to update the stock of each
item.
○ Function Name: updateStock(items)
○ Objective: Write a function that takes an array of items (each containing an
itemId and quantity) and updates the inventory by reducing the stock level
for each item accordingly. If an item goes out of stock (i.e., the stock becomes 0),
it should log a message: "Item [itemId] is out of stock."
